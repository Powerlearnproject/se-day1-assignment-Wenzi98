#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software systems in a structured and efficient way. Its not just writing code it involves planning, testing , teamwork and solving real world problems so the software works reliably for users

Its importance comes from how much we rely on technology today. Without software engineering, apps ot systems would be buggy, hard to scale. It ensures tech solves problems effectively, saves time and money and adapts as needs grow. Think of everything from your phones apps to medical systems, none would function smoothly withou the organized approach software engineering provides


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1960s: "Software Engineering" begins - The tem=rm was created to fix messy, failing projects by treating coding like real engineering  structured anf planned

2. 1980s: Object-Oriented Programming- Code became reusable  blocks like c++ making complex apps easier to build and update

3. 2000s: Agile Development- Teams switched to flexible, fast methods(Agile) instead of rigid plans, letting software adapt as needs change

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define the project scope, goals, and resources. Figure out what the software needs to do and create a roadmap.

Analysis: Gather detailed requirements. Talk to stakeholders to understand their needs and document what the software should achieve.

Design: Create a blueprint for the software. Decide on the architecture, features, and how everything will work together.

Development: Write the actual code. Developers build the software based on the design specifications.

Testing: Check for bugs and errors. Testers make sure the software works as intended and fix any issues.

Deployment: Release the software to users. This could be a full launch or a phased rollout.

Maintenance: Keep the software updated. Fix bugs, add new features, and ensure it continues to meet user needs over time.





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear: finish one phase before the next. Good for fixed, predictable projects like building a bridge. 
Example: Government projects with strict rules.

Agile is flexible: work in sprints, adapt as you go. Great for evolving projects like apps. 
Example: A startup building a new product with user feedback.

Difference: Waterfall is rigid; Agile is adaptive. Use Waterfall for stable projects, Agile for changing ones.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code. They build features, fix bugs, and ensure the software works as designed. 
Example: Coding a new login feature.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software for bugs and issues. They create test cases, run tests, and ensure the product meets quality standards. 
Example: Checking if the login feature works across different devices.

Project Manager: Oversees the project. They plan timelines, manage resources and keep the team on track. 
Example: Coordinating between developers and QA to meet deadlines.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs (like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA) make coding easier by providing features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and auto-completion. They streamline writing, testing, and fixing code in one place. 
Example: A developer uses an IDE to quickly build and debug a new feature.

VCS (like Git or GitHub) tracks changes to code, allowing teams to collaborate without overwriting each other’s work. It also helps revert to previous versions if something breaks. 
Example: A team uses Git to merge code from multiple developers into a single project.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements: Clients or stakeholders often change their minds.
Solution: Use Agile methods to adapt quickly and communicate regularly.

Tight Deadlines: Projects often have unrealistic timelines.
Solution: Break tasks into smaller chunks, prioritize, and set clear expectations.

Debugging Complex Code: Finding and fixing bugs can be time-consuming.
Solution: Write clean, modular code and use debugging tools in your IDE.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or pieces of code (like a single function). Ensures each part works correctly on its own. Example: Checking if a login function validates passwords properly.

Integration Testing: Tests how different modules or services work together. Catches issues when components interact. Example: Testing if the login feature works with the user database.

System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole. Ensures the software meets requirements and works in a real-world environment. Example: Testing the full application from end to end.

Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets user needs and is ready for release. Often done by stakeholders or end-users. Example: Letting a client test the app to see if it meets their expectations
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear, specific, and effective instructions (prompts) to get the best results from AI models. It’s like giving the AI the right "nudge" to understand exactly what you want.

Why it’s important: AI models, like ChatGPT, rely heavily on the input they receive. A well-designed prompt ensures accurate, relevant, and useful responses. Poor prompts can lead to vague or off-target answers. For example, instead of asking, "Tell me about history," a better prompt would be, "Explain the causes of World War II in simple terms."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about space."
This is too broad—what about space? The AI might give a general overview but it won’t be useful if you’re looking for something specific.

Improved Prompt: "Explain how black holes form in 3-4 sentences."
This is clear, specific, and concise. It tells the AI exactly what you want (formation of black holes) and how much detail to provide (3-4 sentences).

Why it’s better: The improved prompt gives the AI focus and direction leading to a more relevant and useful response. It saves time and avoids unnecessary information
